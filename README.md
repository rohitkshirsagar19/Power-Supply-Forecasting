# Power-Supply-Forecasting

This repository contains a Python script to predict the energy required (measured in MU) based on historical data. The script leverages machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression, to forecast energy requirements and evaluate their performance. Additionally, an ensemble model is created to improve prediction accuracy.

This project demonstrates the process of developing a predictive model, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model evaluation and optimization.
